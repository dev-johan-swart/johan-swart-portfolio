![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

A modern, minimalist **Weather App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, using a secure **Node.js Express proxy** to fetch live weather data from the **OpenWeather API** — without exposing your API key.  

This project demonstrates clean UI design, asynchronous JavaScript, environment variable usage, and API integration — perfect for showcasing front-end and API-handling skills to potential employers.
